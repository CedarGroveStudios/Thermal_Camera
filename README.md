## Overview

The Thermal Camera is a portable AMG8833-based thermopile array imager device implemented using CircuitPython on an Adafruit PyGamer or PyBadge SAMD51 handheld gaming platform. Features include measurement and imaging of 64 discrete temperatures within the range of 0 to 80 degress Celsius, adjustable color display gradient range, settable alarm threshold with audible alarm, image snapshot, image and histogram display modes, and an automatic temperature range focus option. The PyGamer/PyBadge platform provides the color display, control buttons, a speaker for the audible alarm, and room for a LiPo rechargable battery.
This implementation uses the Adafruit AMG8833 Thermal Camera FeatherWing. The breakout board version of the camera could be used via the Stemma interface in cases where the camera is to be mounted indepently of the PyGamer/PyBadge unit.

## Project Description

## Primary Project Objectives

A section of duct for the clothes dryer in our late 1940s-era home seemed to be prone to developing obstructions. It's scheduled to be replaced in a couple of months, but until it is, we'll keep a pretty close eye on it and clean it often. If only there was a way to monitor airflow and temperature along that 2 meter section.
The first duct monitor designs used thermistors and eventually thermocouples connected to an Adafruit Feather M4 Express. Code was to be be written in CircuitPython. Some graphic visualization would be nice as would a wireless IoT approach, but monitoring with a local audible alarm were more important.
